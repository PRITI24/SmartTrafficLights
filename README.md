In this repository you can find the code and a research paper (in Serbian) for making smart traffic lights.
You can find an illustration of traffic lights cycle for crossroads and an illustration of fuzzy membership functions.

We used Fuzzy logic to create the "brain" for traffic lights and to imitate how humans would think in that situation.
We implemented a simulator with 6 types of crossroads comparing them to the conventional traffic lights system.

Implementation is done in C++ and Qt5 library.
