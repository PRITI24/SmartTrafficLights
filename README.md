In this repository you can find code and research paper (in Serbian) for making smart traffic lights.
You can find illustration of traffic lights cycle for crossroads and illustration of fuzzy membership functions.

We used Fuzzy logic to create brain for traffic lights and to imitate how humans would think in that situation.
We implemented simulator with 6 types of crossroads comparing them to the conventional traffic lights system.

Implementation is with C++ and Qt5 library.
